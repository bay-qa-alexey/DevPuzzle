Hello,

An attachment contains Visual Studio project on c#.
Project contains 4 tasks with descriptions and samples for testing.

A few notes about tasks:
• You need to have Visual Studio 2017 to open puzzles.sln.
• Tasks should be solved in C# and they don’t require any additional libraries or special constructions. (if you know Java it’s enough to solve because C# syntax is identical to Java for simple cases)
• Each task is more complicated that previous one.
• Each task has couple of tests for your convivence, but passed tests don’t guarantee that code works 100% right.
• We expect from you solve completely puzzle1 and puzzle2.
• Puzzle3, puzzle4 are more complex and they have 2 criteria: right answer and performance. We don’t expect from you to solve them completely.

Criteria for code:
• ‘Clean code’ – for reading.
• Don’t leave obvious or long comments, instead give good names for variables and methods

Software Requirements: Visual Studio 2017
